# Agentic AI for Test Automation: Use Cases with Local LLMs

Agentic AI, with its ability to perceive, reason, act, and learn, can revolutionize various aspects of test automation. When powered by local LLMs like those from Ollama, you gain enhanced control and privacy.

## Here are some key use cases:

### Dynamic Test Case Generation:
User Story/Scenario to Test Cases: An agent can take a user story, feature description, or even a brief conversation about a new functionality, analyze it using the LLM, and generate a comprehensive suite of functional, negative, and boundary test cases.
Based on Code/Application Analysis: An agent can analyze source code, UI elements, or API specifications (e.g., OpenAPI docs) to identify potential test areas and automatically generate test cases that cover various paths and interactions.
Regression Test Suite Enhancement: The agent can review historical bug reports, production incidents, and current code changes to suggest new regression test cases or modify existing ones to prevent recurrence of issues.

### Automated Test Script Generation & Self-Healing:

UI Automation Script Generation: Given a test case or a description of a user flow, an agent can generate automation scripts for frameworks like Playwright, Selenium, Cypress, or Appium.
API Test Script Generation: The agent can create API test scripts (e.g., using requests in Python, Postman collections) based on API documentation or by observing network traffic during manual testing.
Self-Healing Tests: When UI elements change (e.g., locators), an agent can intelligently identify the new locator based on visual context or updated application structure and automatically update the broken test scripts, reducing test maintenance overhead.

### Intelligent Test Data Generation:

Realistic Data for Edge Cases: Based on input schemas or business rules, an agent can generate realistic and diverse test data, including edge cases, invalid inputs, and data to simulate specific scenarios (e.g., large user base, specific date formats).
Privacy-Preserving Synthetic Data: For sensitive applications, agents can generate synthetic test data that mimics the characteristics of real data without compromising privacy.

### Test Result Analysis and Reporting:

Intelligent Log Analysis: Agents can analyze extensive test logs, identify patterns of failures, categorize bugs (e.g., UI, API, performance), and pinpoint the root cause of issues faster than manual review.
Automated Bug Reporting: Upon identifying a bug, an agent can draft a detailed bug report, including steps to reproduce, expected vs. actual results, screenshots (if integrated with a UI automation agent), and system information, ready for review and submission to a bug tracker.
Test Suite Optimization Suggestions: Based on test execution results, an agent can suggest which tests to prioritize, de-duplicate redundant tests, or identify areas with low test coverage.

### Performance and Security Test Scenario Generation:

Load Test Scenario Creation: An agent can generate realistic user load scenarios for performance testing based on typical user behavior patterns.
Basic Security Test Case Generation: For initial checks, an agent can suggest common security vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, XSS) and generate basic test cases to identify them.
Building an Agentic AI System for Test Automation with AutoGen and Ollama
We'll create a multi-agent system using AutoGen, where different agents specialize in parts of the test automation workflow, all powered by local Ollama LLMs.

### System Architecture Overview

Our system will consist of the following AutoGen agents:

User Proxy Agent (UserProxyAgent): This agent acts as the interface for the human user. It receives instructions, relays them to the appropriate AI agent, and displays the results. It can also execute code generated by other agents.
Test Plan Generator Agent (AssistantAgent): This agent will be responsible for understanding the user's request and breaking it down into a detailed test plan, including the types of tests needed (functional, negative), and high-level scenarios.
Test Case Generator Agent (AssistantAgent): Takes a test plan and generates specific, detailed test cases (e.g., in Gherkin format, or a structured JSON).
Code Generator Agent (AssistantAgent): Given a test case, this agent will generate the actual automation code (e.g., Playwright Python scripts, Python requests for API tests).
Test Executor Agent (UserProxyAgent with code_execution_config): This agent will execute the generated automation code and capture results. It will leverage the code execution capabilities of UserProxyAgent.
Test Report Analyzer Agent (AssistantAgent): This agent will take the execution results (logs, success/failure status) and provide a summary, identify issues, and suggest improvements.

## Installation

1.  **Initialize git (Windows):**
    Run the `000_init.bat` file.

2.  **Create a virtual environment (Windows):**
    Run the `001_env.bat` file.

3.  **Activate the virtual environment (Windows):**
    Run the `002_activate.bat` file.

4.  **Install dependencies:**
    Run the `003_setup.bat` file. This will install all the packages listed in `requirements.txt`.

5.  **Deactivate the virtual environment (Windows):**
    Run the `008_deactivate.bat` file.

## Usage

1.  **Run the main application (Windows):**
    Run the `004_run.bat` file.

## Batch Files (Windows)

This project includes the following batch files to help with common development tasks on Windows:

* `000_init.bat`: Initialized git and also usn and pwd config setup also done.
* `001_env.bat`: Creates a virtual environment named `venv`.
* `002_activate.bat`: Activates the `venv` virtual environment.
* `003_setup.bat`: Installs the Python packages listed in `requirements.txt` using `pip`.
* `004_run.bat`: Executes the main Python script (`main.py`).
* `005_deactivate.bat`: Deactivates the currently active virtual environment.
